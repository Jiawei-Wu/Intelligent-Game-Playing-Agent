# Implement Min-Max Algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to design an Intellient Game player.
# In a typical zero sum two player game, players are generally competing for a certain common resource, and their gain is a function of their share of the resource. 
# Often players have other challenges such as satisfying other constraints on other personal resources such as time,  energy  or  computational  power  in  the  course  of  the  game.  In  this  homework  we will introduce 
# The Fruit Rage!a game that captures the nature of a zero sum two player game with strict limitation on allocated time for reasoning
